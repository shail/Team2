This was my first Ruby program! I worked with Jeremy Taylor, Andrew Dennis, Jon Castillo, and Douglas Calhoun. 

This program is essentially an e-mail bot. It gets a config.yml from the user with it's email box information. All e-mails sent to that inbox addressed to twitter or weather would go off and make API calls, returning the query information back to the sender.

First attempt at TDD'ing as well.
